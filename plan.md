Things to achieve


// create a new npm init
// use express to create routes
// use npm pg for SQL
// use env to encode our credentials. 
// use nodemon to automatically run. 

What to create. 

To start with have data on the computer and retrieve information from here. 
Then, we will use SQL and a database in the cloud. 

We have out main app.js file that runs the app.

we have a router file where our routes live

We have a models folder where the functions live 

We have a databases folder where our information lives

we will have a scripts file for our SQL functions. 


To start - work on recreating the routes to get the information from the object. 
Then look at using SQL. 
First revisit last week.
